# Welcome ðŸ‘‹

I used to think the terminal was confusing and only used for _hacking into the mainfraime_, so I tried to avoid it. At university it crept up on me, and I learned that in its most basic form it's not all that complicated. Thus, I built this incredibly **over-engineered CV** to serve as a first step for those fearful of getting technical, and also as a fun way to design my portfolio/CV site. I used Tailwind CSS with Vue 3 and Vite to build this static page.

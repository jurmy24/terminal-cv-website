## Up for a challenge?

I used to think the terminal was confusing, so I tried to avoid it. At university it crept up on me, and I learned that in its most basic form it's not all that complicated. That said, I hope that this incredibly **over-engineered CV** can serve as a first step for those fearful of getting technical.

## > Nah

If navigating my CV file system seems boring you can essentially find the same information on my LinkedIn or GitHub accounts.

## Project Overview

In Europe alone, over 50 million people live in countries where they don’t speak the native language fluently. Additionally, educational systems emphasize learning several second languages from a young age. Traditional methods, like grammar exercises on Duolingo, have limitations. With advancements in generative AI, real-time, natural-sounding voice bots have become a reality. However, current language learning voice bots lack a research-based design that aligns with how the human brain naturally learns—through storytelling.

## Our Solution

At Utter, we've designed an interactive storytelling concept that leverages intelligent voicebot narrators. These narrators tell bite-sized, hand-curated stories and engage users directly to enhance their speaking skills. This approach mimics the natural storytelling method, similar to how a parent reads a bedtime story to a child, making language learning more intuitive and effective.

## Technical Development

-   **Initial Versions**: We have developed two versions of the app, one using Swift and another on React Native with a NestJS backend.
-   **Current Focus**: Pivoting towards storytelling to create a more immersive and effective language learning experience.

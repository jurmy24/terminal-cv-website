# Interests

Alright, this is my **favourite** page. It's already quite obvious that I quite enjoy building personal projects in different areas of engineering so here I'll talk about the other stuff.

## Scuba diving

I'm not a super experienced diver, having done around 20 dives in various places with the **PADI open water license**. My favorite dive site is Turtle City but one day I would like to go back to SmÃ¶gen (where the image was taken) to do a winter dive. Apparently when there is ice the visibility improves significantly.

## Mountain stuff

If I'm not 18 meters underwater I do like being around 2500 meters above it. I love hiking and skiing, which is one of the main reasons why I decided to do my exchange at EPFL in Switzerland. With frequent trains from Lausanne, it was easy to get deep into the alps. The image above was taken during a trip to Oeschinensee in Switzerland where we got to take a dip in the cold turquoise water.

## Learning languages

In my family we speak both swedish and norwegian together, which is actually quite normal in Scandinavia as the languages are so similar. However, we moved to Luxembourg when I was 6 where I was quite quickly forced to study english, french, and german. After I moved to Sweden at 15 I wanted to keep up with my french and german skills so I found myself a couple of language partners to practice with and I haven't looked back since. I consider myself fluent in the first four ğŸ‡¬ğŸ‡§ğŸ‡³ğŸ‡´ğŸ‡¸ğŸ‡ªğŸ‡«ğŸ‡·, but will hopefully get there one day with german ğŸ‡©ğŸ‡ª.

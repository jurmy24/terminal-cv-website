# About me

This is, in-fact, a CV so it will all be about me.

## Where I'm from

I am a ğŸ‡³ğŸ‡´ Norwegian and ğŸ‡¸ğŸ‡ª Swedish engineering student that grew up in several countries in Europe, together with my two older sisters and parents ğŸ‘«. Born in Norway, grew up in Luxembourg, and finished high school and uni in Sweden. There have also been a few short stints where I lived in ğŸ‡©ğŸ‡° Denmark, ğŸ‡¨ğŸ‡­ Switzerland (exchange), and ğŸ‡¹ğŸ‡¿ Tanzania too. In the future I'd like to live somewhere like Switzerland because just look at that (AI-generated but the fact still holds):

## What I'm doing

I just finished up a Master in machine learning at KTH (under the 5-year industrial engineering and management program). Currently I'm finishing a second bachelors in mechanical engineering at KTH to complement my digital skills and management theory with a more hands-on counterpart.

## How can you talk to me?

-   ğŸ‡¬ğŸ‡§ English (bilingual)
-   ğŸ‡³ğŸ‡´ Norsk (native)
-   ğŸ‡¸ğŸ‡ª Svenska (native)

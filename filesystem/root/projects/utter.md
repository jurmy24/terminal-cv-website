## Project Overview

In Europe alone, over 50 million people live in countries where they don’t speak the native language fluently. Additionally, educational systems emphasize learning several second languages from a young age. Traditional methods, like grammar exercises on Duolingo, have limitations. With advancements in generative AI, real-time, natural-sounding voice bots have become a reality. However, current language learning voice bots lack a research-based design that aligns with how the human brain naturally learns—through storytelling.

## The Solution

At Utter, we designed an interactive storytelling concept that leverages intelligent voicebot narrators. These narrators tell bite-sized, hand-curated stories and engage users directly to enhance their speaking skills. This approach mimics the natural storytelling method, similar to how a parent reads a bedtime story to a child, making language learning more intuitive and effective.

## Technical Development

-   **Initial Versions**: I have developed three versions of the app, the first in Swift, the second in React Native with a NestJS backend, and the third using Swift and firebase
-   **Recent developments**: I built the third version of the app using firebase and SwiftUI in early September 2024

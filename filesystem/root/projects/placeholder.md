This is a bit stealth for now, but I can show some cool related stuff I've been building.

# URDF Web Visualizer

This is a simple tool built with a combination of Lovable and Cursor. I use the urdf-loaders package to load the URDF file + meshes and display it in the browser. Then I extract the information from the URDF file and display it in a sidebar. A fun extra feature is that you can run an animation in plain language that's generated for you.
